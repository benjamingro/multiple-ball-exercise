Week 2 - Multiple Ball Exercise
=================
This repository was created to show my work for the coding assignment in week 2, which is to do a simple HTML / JavaScript animation of balls move back and forth on the screen.  

This homework submission shows the following balls in motion in the index.html file. 

Ball #1 - Black Ball moving at fixed velocity in a back and forth motion. 

Ball #2 - Same as Ball #1 except ball color traverses the color spectrum from red to blue as a function of position. 

Ball #3 - Same as Ball #2 except size changes as a sinusoidal function of position. 

Ball #4 -  Same as Ball #2 except velocity changes exponentially.
